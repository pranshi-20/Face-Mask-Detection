# Face-Mask-Detection
Face mask detection system built using opencv and tensorflow
It can be used to detect face masks in both static images and real time video.

## It Uses-
- OpenCv
- Keras
- Tensorflow
- MobileNetV2

We can also use a simple convolutional neural network model but we MobileNetV2 since it is computationally efficient.

## Dataset
I download the dataset from the drive link on this github profile.
